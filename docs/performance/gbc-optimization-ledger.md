# Game Boy Color optimization ledger

This ledger records retained and rejected GBC performance experiments. Each
experiment is isolated, tested for native/GBC parity, measured on the fixed
suite below, and committed separately when retained. Optimization commit
messages include the headline speed and memory deltas.

## Measurement protocol

- Emulator: mGBA SDL 0.10.5, CGB-only cartridge, CGB double-speed mode.
- Timing source: emulated CGB 4096 Hz hardware timer.
- Repetitions: three complete emulator boots; every counter must be identical.
- Logic sample: 128 alternating right/left turns on the first board level.
- Rendering sample: four frames, plus isolated composition, tile upload,
  tile-map upload, and palette upload loops.
- Memory: exporter session/SRAM/game-bank estimates plus linked benchmark ROM
  map usage.
- Correctness gate: focused GBC tests and mGBA render smoke for every experiment;
  all native/C++ tests and the compatible-game cartridge audit before milestone
  commits.
- Desktop gate: generic C++ changes also run the 64-bit simulation and solver
  suites against their immediately preceding commit.

The low-overhead total-timing ROM is the source of headline timings. A separate
`PERF_PHASES=1` ROM adds probes around snapshot, setup, early rules, movement,
late rules, commands, and win checks. Probe overhead is reported rather than
silently folded into the headline.

## Baseline

Target revision: `80ad5a59` (`Add bounded Game Boy Color target`).

| Case | Shape | Logic ticks/turn | Render ticks/frame | Composition | Session bytes | Snapshot SRAM | Game bank estimate |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| sokoban | 6 objects, 42 cells, 4 rules | 726.531 | 144243.250 | 143522.500 | 347 | 840 | 1494 |

| object_heavy | 20 objects, 72 cells, 33 rules | 14468.445 | 217342.500 | 216670.500 | 500 | 1440 | 5670 |

Tile upload is approximately 548 ticks/frame, map upload 98.5 ticks/frame, and
palette upload 4 ticks/frame in every case. Composition accounts for more than
99% of measured rendering time, so rendering experiments start there.

For Sokoban, phase probes increase whole-turn timing from 726.531 to 740.586
ticks/turn (+1.93%). The instrumented breakdown is:

| Phase | Ticks/turn |
| --- | ---: |
| Snapshot write | 50.078 |
| Setup/player movement seed | 45.109 |
| Early rules | 533.914 |
| Movement resolution | 51.039 |
| Late rules | 1.352 |
| Commands | 4.070 |
| Win check | 42.328 |
